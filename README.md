# The main application relies on an english dictionary found here: https://github.com/tusharlock10/Dictionary

## This python file scrapes BeerAdvocate.com based on user-provided URL for beer reviews, and rewrites those reviews using simple replacement logic based on word type (nouns and adjectives are replaced with synonyms)

### Build the dictionary using dictionary_builder function after downloading files from above linked github repo.
